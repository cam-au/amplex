<p>Petra is ancient historian, digital epigrapher, archaeologist specializing in the epigraphic production of ancient Thrace and the neigbouring regions. In her research Petra combines her experience in Archaeology and Classics, using digitally enhanced quantitative approaches towards Epigraphy in order to assess long term socio-cultural changes and their effect on the population of the SE Europe in Antiquity. As part of her postdoctoral project at Aarhus University, she is focusing on the <i>dynamics of epigraphic culture</i> in correlation to other material and environmental datasets in order to tackle <i>the general trends and patterns of epigraphic production</i> in the Ancient Mediterranean. <b>Research big or go home!</b></p>

<p>Petra has 10+ years of archaeological fieldwork experience, participating in various projects in Israel, Greece, Bulgaria, Italy, Czech Republic and Australia. The range of projects covers the traditional excavations, systematic field surveys, epigraphic field prospection, but also satellite remote sensing and analysis. As part of her involvement in <i>the FAIMS Project</i>, she worked as project manager for custom digital solutions aimed to field research. She is experienced in day-to-day software development management as well as handling of multiple and complex digital projects at the same time. Her portfolio of 15+ projects from 2016-2018 contains i. e. archaeological excavations in China (TRAP) and in Turkey (Boncuklu), archaeological transect surveys in Malawi (MEMSAP) and Australia (Lake Mungo), ecological projects in New South Wales, Australia (Griffith Ecology Lab; AWARE Project), or geochemical sampling in Western Australia (CSIRO).</p>  

<p>Petra is interested in the application of digital approaches to the traditional scholarship and is pioneering her way into the world of <i>digital epigraphy</i>. She loves to promote the culture of a reproducible science and the FAIR data principles and she keen on helping other researchers to discover the world of automation, data wrangling, data modelling, visualisation, preservation of information, quantitative statistical analysis and the spatio-temporal uncertainty of historic/archaeological data. Petra can help you with: Spatial data (using QGIS, ArcGIS, Carto, Fusion Tables, Google Earth), data modelling and data capture (FAIMS and XML, PostgreSQL), data modification and analysis (RegEx, Python, R), typesetting (ConTeXt, Overleaf), version control and team-collaborative work (GitHub, Atlassian JIRA & Confluence). Petra is certified Cerpentries instructor and is interested in further building the community of digital enthousiasts!</p>

<p> Vojtěch is a social scientist with background in scientific study of religion, interested in long-term dynamics of human societies. He approaches these phenomena from a naturalistic standpoint, adopting theories from cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, cultural evolution and human behavioral ecology. Methodologically, he has experience with various computational methods and tools, mainly agent-based modeling, network analysis and text-mining.</p>

<p>In March 2019, Vojtěch has successfully defended PhD dissertation entitled "Tracing the Origins of Eucharistic Magic: On the Role of Cognitive Attraction in the Cultural Transmission of Collective Rituals" (available from [here](https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/299414) or [here]("https://is.muni.cz/th/yqobt/?lang=en;id=274233). He pursued his doctoral studies under a cotutelle agreement between the University of Helsinki, Finland and Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.</p>

<p>Over the recent years, Vojtěch has been part of two interedsciplinary research project: (1) [REECR: Ritual and the Emergence of Early Christian Religion: A Socio-Cognitive Analysis](http://blogs.helsinki.fi/ritual-earlychristianity/) based at  University of Helsinki and led by Risto Uro, and (2) [GEHIR: Generative Historiography of Religion Project](http://gehir.phil.muni.cz) based at Masaryk University and led by Aleš Chalupa.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with his position in Aarhus, he is also working at the Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Arts, University of West Bohemia, Plzeň, Czech Republic, where he is teaching undergraduate courses in Digital Humanities.</p>>
