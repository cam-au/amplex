<p>Petra is ancient historian, digital epigrapher, archaeologist specializing in the epigraphic production of ancient Thrace and the neigbouring regions. In her research Petra combines her experience in Archaeology and Classics, using digitally enhanced quantitative approaches towards Epigraphy in order to assess long term socio-cultural changes and their effect on the population of the SE Europe in Antiquity. As part of her postdoctoral project at Aarhus University, she is focusing on the dynamics of epigraphic culture in correlation to other material and environmental datasets in order to tackle the general trends and patterns of epigraphic production in the Ancient Mediterranean. <b>Research big or go home!</b></p>

<p>Petra has 10+ years of archaeological fieldwork experience, participating in various projects in Israel, Greece, Bulgaria, Italy, Czech Republic and Australia. The range of projects covers the traditional excavations, systematic field surveys, epigraphic field prospection, but also satellite remote sensing and analysis. As part of her involvement in the FAIMS Project, she worked as project manager for custom software development aimed to field research. She is experienced in day-to-day software development management as well as handling of multiple and complex digital projects at the same time. Her portfolio of 15+ projects from 2016-2018 contains i. e. archaeological excavations in China (TRAP) and in Turkey (Boncuklu), archaeological transect surveys in Malawi (MEMSAP) and Australia (Lake Mungo), ecological projects in New South Wales, Australia (Griffith Ecology Lab; AWARE Project), or geochemical sampling in Western Australia (CSIRO).</p>  

<p>Petra is interested in the application of digital approaches to the traditional scholarship and is pioneering her way into the world of digital epigraphy. She loves to promote the culture of a reproducible science and the FAIR data principles and she keen on helping other researchers to discover the world of automation, data wrangling, data modelling, visualisation, preservation of information, quantitative statistical analysis and the spatio-temporal uncertainty of historic/archaeological data. Petra can help you with: Spatial data (using QGIS, ArcGIS, Carto, Fusion Tables, Google Earth), data modelling and data capture (FAIMS and XML, PostgreSQL), data modification and analysis (RegEx, Python, R), typesetting (ConTeXt, Overleaf), version control and team-collaborative work (GitHub, Atlassian JIRA & Confluence). Petra is certified Cerpentries instructor and is interested in building the community of digital enthousiasts!</p>
