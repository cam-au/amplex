Hello, world!

You have landed on my personal research site, dedicated to various experiments with digital epigraphy and quantitative analysis of inscriptions. I love to think about inscriptions as petrified voices coming from the past, delivering messages from people quite similar to us. I truly believe, that by studying inscriptions in large quantities we can learn not only about our past, but also about our daily lives.

You can follow me either on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pettulda), [Github](https://github.com/petrajanouchova), via [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6349-0540) or [my project on OSF](https://osf.io/fjnw5/).

I love to talk about inscriptions, archaeology, history or cats. Most days you can find me either staring at the computer screen, drinking coffee in the cool hipster place, hiking outdoors, or in the gym!

#### The technology behind the scene:

I am using a custom Jekyll theme - Centrarium, made by [Ben Centra](https://github.com/bencentra). Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).
You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). And you can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
