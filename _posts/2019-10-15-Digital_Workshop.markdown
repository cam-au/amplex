Hello, dear digital enthousiast!

We are organising a one day workshop on Digital Approaches to research in Humanities and Social Sciences which you should not miss out!
You will hear about the need of building the technical infrastructure, the frustrations of venturing the digital research in the more traditional and conservative fields such as history or epigraphy. We will talk about the joys of collaboration, data standards and exchange of datasets and you will learn more about the exciting ongoing digital projects all around the globe!

The full program with links to our speakers can be accessed via <a href="http://bit.ly/2OJTQoV">this link</a>.

Please, contact me if you need more details (**petra.hermankova@cas.au.dk** or <a href="https://twitter.com/pettulda">@pettulda</a> on Twitter!).
