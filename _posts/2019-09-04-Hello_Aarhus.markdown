Hello, folks!

It has been a while since I have posted anything. As usual, there has been quite a development in the past few months. I got married and chnaged my last name from **Janouchová** to **Heřmánková**, so if you haven't recognized the name at first, you are not the only one confused.

And for the news no. 2, I have been offred and accepted a Postdoc position at Aarhus University in Denmark! Yay!

In the next few days I will be posting more about the team and the project we all be working on for the next three years!
